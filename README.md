# Differential Equations and Applications (`Math 302`) PILOT @ Johns Hopkins University

This is a course in ordinary differential equations (ODEs), equations involving an unknown function of one independent variable and some of its derivatives, and is primarily a course in the study of the structure of and techniques for solving ODEs as mathematical models. Specific topics include first and second ODEs of various types, systems of linear differential equations, autonomous systems, and the qualitative and quantitative analysis of nonlinear systems of first-order ODEs. Laplace transforms, series solutions and the basics of numerical solutions are included as extra topics.

Common Resources:
- [Conceptual Problem Set](/resources/Conceptual-Problem-Set.pdf):
    - A specially designed extra problem set is updated for students who are interested in mathematical proof and fun questions underlying ODEs. The extra problem set contains approximately 2 problems for each week. This set is completely voluntary, and its contents are mostly outside the scope of this class (conventionally).
    - If you would like to discuss any of the problems, please contact the HPL.
- [Theorem Booklet](/resources/ODEs-Thms.pdf):
    - This document includes various definitions, theorems, and formulas about ODE that was initially compiled during Fall 2022 and adjusted up until Fall 2024.
- [Laplace Table](/resources/Laplace-Table.pdf):
    - This document includes a table of Laplace transformation that most instructors would provide during their assessments. This document can be a helpful tool before your instructor has provided you with their version.
- [Activity Slide](/resources/Activities.pdf):
    - Here is a set of slides deck that we could be playing with when we need some engagements. Feel free to play with some of it in advance.
